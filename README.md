# Altcoin Generator for Tremendouscoin

This script was utilized by the creator of Tremendouscoin
to figure out what values to use within the
chainparams.cpp file of our litecoin clone
@ https://github.com/tremendouscoin/tremendouscoin

All we had to do was be running Docker (@ http://docker.com),
edit and run the altcoin_generator.sh bash script, wait for a few minutes,
and copy and paste the respective values from the generated GenesisH0 folder!
